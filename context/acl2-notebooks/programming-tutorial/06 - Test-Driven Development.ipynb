    "Professional programmers know a simple fact: If your code isn't **extensively** tested, it's not working. In fact, this is the biggest reason why code reuse is so important. It's not that writing a linked list is hard. You learned how to do that in your first or second programming class. The reason why we use `List<Integer>` instead of writing our own linked list of integers in Java is that `List<Integer>` has been tested extensively, so we can be confident that it works.\n",

Testing is not a thing that you do in class because your professors make you. **Testing is something that you should always do as a a programmer.** In fact, learning how to to test is an essential part of becoming a professional.

For example, you may believe that no matter what the input to your function, it will **never** return null. To test properties like this, you need to test with a large number of inputs, and this is where testing with **random inputs** makes sense.\n",

We had intended `n` to be a natural number, but ACL2 is finding that our property is not true in some cases where `n` is a rational, or a complex number, or a negative integer.

They can help you gain confidence in your program, even though they do give you total guarantee of success.

    "When it really matters that your program works correctly, randomized testing is better than just unit tests, but even randomized testing may not be enough. This is when you consider going the extra mile and **proving** that your property is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACL2 is more than a programming language; it is a state-of-the-art theorem prover. In industry, ACL2 is used in various settings where correctness is essential, e.g., in the design of hardware chips or mission-critical software. We'll use ACL2 to (try to) prove the properties we tested above.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove a property in ACL2, you have two choices\n",
    "\n",
    "* `(thm ...property...)`\n",
    "* `(defthm name ...property...)`\n",
    "\n",
    "The first form tries to prove the property and then essentially forgets about it. The second form gives the property a name, and remembers the property. If ACL2 remembers a property, it is able to use later when proving other properties. This is the way that ACL2 is used in industry. It is almost never the case that ACL2 discovers the proof of your property automatically. So what you have to do is prove a sequence of theorems that lead up to the property you want. Industrial proof efforts will often require hundreds (or thousands) of these intermediate theorems!\n",
    "\n",
    "But let's just try to prove the first property and see what ACL2 can do."

In this particular case, ACL2 used mathematical induction on the variable `n`. Second, it list all the facts that it used in the proof. For example, this proof used the fact called `|(expt (+ x y) 2)|`, which is the familiar result from algebra that $(x+y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2$.

What we see here is that randomized testing hasn't found a bug, but ACL2 cannot find a proof that there aren't any bugs.\n",

    "This is very common. The truth is we got quite lucky with the proof of `TRIANGULAR-FORMULA` above. As we mentioned earlier, this is where you would have to come up with some intermediate properties that ACL2 can use to find the proof of the property we want. The process requires you to look at the proof attempt, try to understand why it failed, and use that to discover a key lemma that may be useful. Often, the \"Key Checkpoints\" that ACL2 mentions at the end of the failed proof attempt are good places to start. The tutorial on \"The Method\" describes this process in more detail. But for this specific property, finding a proof in ACL2 would actually be quite difficult, so we will simply move on. But if you're really interested in this, a proof of this fact (called the Basel Problem) would make a wonderful Master's thesis!"
