    "# Introduction to ACL2\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Better Way to Define Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "You should already know how to define functions using `defun`. That's a great way to define functions, and people have been using `defun` since the 50s (really). But one problem with `defun` is that it introduces variables, but it doesn't make it very clear what values those variables can have. It doesn't even make it clear what the function should return! Is the value of this function an integer, a rational, what? In Java or C++, variables and functions have *types*, but there is no way to talk about types with `defun`. I have seen many students struggle writing programs im ACL2 simply because they get confused about the types of the expressions in their programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is why you should user `definec` instead of `defun` to define functions. The syntax of `definec` is like this\n",
    "\n",
    "    (definec name (arg1 :type1 arg2 :type2 ... argn :typen) :ftype\n",
    "      ...expression...)\n",
    "\n",
    "And this has the same meaning as `defun`, namely\n",
    "\n",
    "    (name arg1 arg2 ... argn) = ...expression...\n",
    "\n",
    "but it also states that `arg1` is of type `type1`, ... `argn` is of type `argn`, and the function returns a value of type `ftype`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate how this works, here are some types that ACL2 understands:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type       | Description                                |\n",
    "|:-----------|:-------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| `int`      | an integer                                 |\n",
    "| `pos`      | a positive integer                         |\n",
    "| `neg`      | a negative integer                         |\n",
    "| `nat`      | a natural number, or non-negative integer  |\n",
    "| `rational` | a rational number                          |\n",
    "| `boolean`  | a boolean value (`T` or `NIL`)             |\n",
    "\n",
    "> You were probably expecting a type of `float`, but there isn't such a type in ACL2. Don't worry, though! All floating-point numbers are actually rational numbers, and `rational` is a valid ACL2 type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's put this to work. Here is a definition of the function `double` which doubles an integer. Go ahead and submit this definition to ACL2."

Specifically, the contract worked just fine when `X` was equal to `194` and `16`, but the contract did not work when `X` was `-5`, `1`, or `-1`. Remember that the \"function contract\" is that the function should return the given type when its inputs have the right type. What ACL2 is saying is that the function is returning a value of the wrong type for the inputs `-5`, `1`, or `-1`. Using that fact, fix the definition and enter it below:"

In fact, variable names **are** symbols, but a symbol doesn't hold a value. Instead, a symbol is its own value. You may want to think of symbols as being similar to strings in other languages. So how can you tell the difference between the symbol `X` (which should just be equal to \"X\") and the variable `X` (which could hold a number, say 3)?  The answer is, like in other languages, symbols must be quoted.\n",

But if you write `X` in a program, that is the variable `X` with some value, e.g., `3`. Don't let this confuse you. It is the same as the difference between `n + 1` and `\"n\" + 1` in other programming languages.\n",
