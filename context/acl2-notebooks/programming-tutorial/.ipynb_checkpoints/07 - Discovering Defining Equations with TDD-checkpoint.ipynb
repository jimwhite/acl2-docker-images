    "# Discovering Defining Equations with Test-Driven Development\n",
    "\n",
    "Test-Driven Development (TDD) is more than just a way of testing code. The proponents of TDD cite many benefits to the practice of writing tests first, **then** writing the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The tests serve as a specification for what the code that will be written should do\n",
    "* Developers are able to understand what the program should do before trying to write it\n",
    "* Developers can use the tests to help design the code that will pass them\n",
    "* Developers aren't afraid to change code as needed, because they know the modified code will be thoroughly tested\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to focus on the third benefit above. We'll use the tests to help us write the code we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiplication by Repeated Addition\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write a function `(mul a b)` that returns `a*b` when `a` and `b` are natural numbers. Of course, we could just use the built-in function `*`, but we are learning how to write recursive functions, so let's write the function ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using TDD, so let's start by thinking of some unit tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (mul 3 10) = 30\n",
    "    (mul 5 19) = 95\n",
    "    (mul 2 10) = 20\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, how should we write this? We are using \"repeated addition\" and going from first principles (no built-in `*`, remember?) so we have to dig deep and remember what multiplication really is. So we let ourselves go back to 3rd grade and remember that $5 \\times 19 = \\underbrace{19 + 19 + \\cdots + 19}_{5\\text{ times}}$. So maybe, we should rewrite our unit tests this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (mul 3 10) = 10 + 10 + 10\n",
    "    (mul 5 19) = 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15\n",
    "    (mul 2 10) = 10 + 10\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, this is the critical moment. What we want to do is to consider the unit tests for a problem and for its \"next smaller\" problem. It takes some practice to find the \"next smaller\", but for natural numbers, the next smaller problem to `n` is usually `n-1`. So let's try that. We see these two unit tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (mul 3 10) = 10 + 10 + 10\n",
    "    (mul 2 10) = 10 + 10\n",
    "\n",
    "If we only had the first unit test, but not the second, I would have proceeded by **adding that second unit test**. That's the TDD approach: We want to make sure that the function returns the right value for some set of inputs and for **any potential set of inputs that may appear in a recursive call** of that original test. Here, we're betting that `(mul 2 10)` is likely to be a recursive call of `(mul 3 10)`, because we are guessing that the \"next smaller\" value of `n` will be `n-1`, which it usually is.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's look at the two unit tests, this time an eye to answering this question:\n",
    "\n",
    "> How can we use the answer to `(mul 2 10)` to find the answer to `(mul 3 10)`?\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, how can we find the answer to the `n` problem by using the answer to the \"next smaller\" value of `n`? Looking at the unit tests, we can conjecture that \n",
    "\n",
    "    (mul 3 10) = 10 + 10 + 10\n",
    "    (mul 2 10) = 10 + 10\n",
    "    ----------------------------\n",
    "    (mul 3 10) = (mul 2 10) + 10\n",
    "\n",
    "We're almost there! What's left is just to generalize this specific equation to a defining equation. I.e., not just `3` and `10`, but any `a` and `b`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (mul a b) = (mul a-1 b) + b\n",
    "\n",
    "This looks promising, so let's write it in ACL2 notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (mul a b) = (+ (mul (- a 1) b) \n",
    "                   b)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not the whole story, of course. We need another defining equation to stop the \"loop\". Let's do the obvious:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (mul a b) = 0,                        if a=0 or anything other than a positive integer\n",
    "    (mul a b) = (+ (mul (- a 1) b) \n",
    "                   b),                    otherwise\n",
    "\n",

    "The results are disappointing. First, it's clear that ACL2 is choosing random values for `a` and `b` that are not what we expect. We meant for `a` and `b` to be natural numbers, but ACL2 is choosing values like `61/85`. To fix this, we need to place a `natp` hypothesis in the property. The more concerning issue is that ACL2 found counterexamples to the last test! It appears that `(mul a b)` is not always the same thing as `(* a b)`. Looking at the values of `a` and `b` that ACL2 claims are counterexamples, it again that appears that the problems only happen when ACL2 tries values for `a` and `b` that are not natural numbers. So let's fix the property to apply only to natural numbers and see what happens."
