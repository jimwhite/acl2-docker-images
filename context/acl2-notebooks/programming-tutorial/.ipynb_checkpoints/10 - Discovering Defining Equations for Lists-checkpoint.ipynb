    "# Discovering Defining Equations for List Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will look at how test-driven development can be used to discover defining equations for list functions. We will start with a simple function, `sumlist`, which returns the sum of the elements in a list.  Let's start with some obvious unit tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (sumlist '(1 2 3 4 5)) = 15\n",
    "    (sumlist '(2 4 6 8))   = 20\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall our approach when using TDD to discover defining equations for funtions over the natural numbers. The idea is to start with the unit tests for a fixed input and its \"next smaller\" input. So what is the next smaller input for lists?\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that that there are many smaller lists. For example, the list =`'(1 2 3 4 5)` can be broken down in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "    `(1 2 3 4 5) = `(1 2 3 4) & 5\n",
    "    `(1 2 3 4 5) = 1 & `(2 3 4 5)\n",
    "    `(1 2 3 4 5) = `(1 2 3) & '(4 5)\n",
    "    `(1 2 3 4 5) = `(1 3 5) & '(2 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is the right \"next smaller\"? It's largely a matter of convenience, but since `first` and `rest` are built-in functions that directly support the second split, this is the one to start with! Notice that is the only reason to prefer the second split over the first.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The last two splits are interesting, and even have names. The first two splits yield a single element and a list that is almost as big as the first one. This is similar to a for loop: Do something to the first element, then loop again to do it to the remaining elements. But splitting the list in half is a good strategy for designing parallel algorithms, because each half can be processed separately, e.g., in different cores. In fact, the third split is often used in merge sort implementations, and both the third and fourth are used (together) in implementations of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which is used extensively in image processing and signal processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have these unit tests, but none of them are the result of splitting up one of the other unit cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (sumlist '(1 2 3 4 5)) = 15\n",
    "    (sumlist '(2 4 6 8))   = 20\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's add some more unit tests based on our \"first+rest\" split.\n",
    "\n",
    "    (sumlist '(1 2 3 4 5)) = 15\n",
    "    (sumlist '(2 3 4 5))   = 14\n",
    "    (sumlist '(2 4 6 8))   = 20\n",
    "    (sumlist '(4 6 8))     = 18\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an important step, so let's capture our unit tests in the TDD Way:"

    "A couple of things are worth pointing out. First, this function expencts the input list to contain some negative numbers, so we use the built-in type `integer-list` instead of `nat-list`. Second, this function returns a list that contain either numbers or dashes. There is no built-in type for these lists, so we used `defdata` to define this type.\n",
    "\n",
    "All tests passed, so again it's time to move to another example. Let's define the function `contains` that checks whether a list contains a given element. Here are some tests we can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (contains 6 '(2 4 6 8 10))   = T\n",

    "    (contains 5 '(2 4 6 8 10))   = (contains 5 '(4 6 8 10)) = NIL\n",
    "\n",
    "But there's nothing that indicates why the first one is `T` and the second `NIL`. It appears that the initial test cases were too big, so we need to explore the next smaller lists more carefully. To do so, we add more unit tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (contains 6 '(2 4 6 8 10))   = T\n",

    "    (contains 5 '(4 6 8 10))     = NIL\n",
    "    (contains 5 '(6 8 10))       = NIL\n",
    "\n",
    "That's better! Now we can see why the first case is returning `T`: The element is right at the front of the list, where we can easily check for it. That suggests this defining equation:\n",

    "    (contains e l) = T,                     if e = (first l)\n",

    "\n",
    "    (contains e l) = NIL,                   if l is not a non-empty list\n",

    "\n",
    "* Find the product of all elements in a list\n",
    "* Find the number of elements in a list (from first principles)\n",
    "* Find the largest element of a list (more challenging)\n",
    "* The input is a list of lists of numbers, and the output is a list that contains all the numbers in order, but in a single list (more challenging)\n",

    "* Return a list whose elements are twice those of the input list\n",
    "* Return a list whose elements are the absolute value of the elements on the input list\n",

    "* Hybrid map/reduce: Return the sum of the absolute value of the elements in a list\n",
