    "| `pos`      | a positive integer                         | 12      |\n",
    "| `neg`      | a negative integer                         | -5      |\n",

    "\n",
    "Recall that each type features a \"colon\" keyword that names the type for function definitions and an ACL2 function that recognizes values of that type. For example, when you define a function that accepts a natural number as a parameter, you use the `:nat` keyword, and the function `(natp x)` returns true precisely when `x` is a natural number. The same is true for `:boolean` and `(booleanp x)`, and so on. Notice that the leuwprd has a `:` in front of the type name, and the function that recognizes elements of that type has a `p` at the end of the type name.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now going to define new types, and each new type will have a name, and the associated \"colon\" keyword and function recognizer (ending in `p`). Types are defined using\n",

    "\n",
    "The type specifier is an ACL2 expressions that describes elements of the new type. We introduce these specifiers by example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with **range types** These refer to a subset of one of the numeric types. For example, the integers from 0 to 9 can be specified as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (defdata single-digit\n",
    "             (range integer (0 <= _ < 10)))\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the range of valid numbers is specified. You can specify a lower bound, an upper bound, or both. And you can use `<=` or `<` to indicate whether the bound is inclusive or exclusive. The `_` is used as a placeholder for the number that is being defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Range types are cool, and some languages still support them, though they are not nearly as popular as they used to be. But think, for example, of a specific type that captures the valid indexes for an array. Pascal and Ada could do that.\n",

    "Next, let's consider **enumerations**. These are very popular in other languages. E.g., in C, you can say\n",
    "\n",
    "    typedef enum { RED, GREEN, BLUE } color\n",
    "\n",
    "to define a type that contains just those three enumerated values. In ACL2, you would write\n",

    "    (defdata color\n",
    "             (enum '(red green blue)))\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "    (colorp `green)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the possible values are symbols, so you must qouote them with a leading single quote. In some ways, enumerations are siomilar to range types, except they introduce subsets of possible symbol values instead of subsets of possible numeric values.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Aside:** Take another look at the way the colors are specified: `'(red green blue)`. There are two new concepts here. First, ACL2 supports **lists**, which are actually the major data structure. Here, the list contains the values \"red\", \"green\", and \"blue\". But if you see the expression `(red green blue)` in ACL2, you would interpret that as the call of the function \"red\" with the paramaters \"green\" and \"bluie\" (which are variable names). The single quote in front of the list is what says \"this is not a function call, just take me literally\". I.e., a single quote is used to quote the next word, as in `'green`, but it actually quotes the next expression. In `'(red green blue)`. the entire list of colors is quoted.\n",

    "Next up, let's consider **union types**, for example, a member of a type could be either an integer or a symbol; that's the union of the types `integer` and `symbol`. Here is a nice example. A `hex-digit` is either a `single-digit` (a range type defined above) or a letter from `a` go `f`:\n",

    "## Composite Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "**Composite types** store more than one value. In languages like C++, this corresponds to a class or a struct. As we saw in a previous tutorial, ACL2 uses lists to support composite types. Now let's see how lists can be used to define new types.\n",
    "\n",
    "In ACL2, lists are often (over-)used to represent **product types**. A product type is a pair, or triple, or ..., or n-tuple. That is, a product types consists of a fixed number of elements, each of which is of a particular type. For example, you could represent a date using three numbers, for the date, month, and year:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (defdata date\n",
    "             (list (range integer (1 <= _ <= 12))\n",
    "                   (range integer (1 <= _ <= 31))\n",
    "                   (range integer (1 <= _ <= 2100))))\n",
    "\n",
    "Then `(datep (list 1 19 2021))` would be true. Here is another example. You may define a person type that keeps track of a person's first name, last name, and birthdate:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (defdata person\n",
    "             (list symbol\n",
    "                   symbol\n",

    "For example, `(personp '(john galt (10 10 1957)))` would be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that **product types** are simply special types of lists, and it is the programmer's responsibility to know, for example, that the first element is the first name, the second is the last name, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try it! Define a **product type** that can represent a two-dimensional point, given by its `x` and `y` coordinates."

    "I recommend that you stick with product types when you're learning ACL2, but at some point you may be interested in using something more similar to records in other languages. ACL2 also supports **record types**, which are similar to product types, but with the added feature that the fields in the records have names. For example, here is an alternative way to define the date type:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (defdata month (range integer (1 <= _ <= 12)))\n",
    "    (defdata day   (range integer (1 <= _ <= 31)))\n",

    "             (record (mm . month)\n",
    "                     (dd . day) \n",
    "                     (yy . year)))\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the types for the fields in the records must be type **names**, not type expressions, so we first gave names to the types for months, days, and years.\n",
    "\n",
    "> What are those dots in `(mm . month)`? It turns out that lists are **not** the most fundamental data structure in ACL2. The fundamental composite data structure is the pair of elements, written `(x . y)`. Lists are, in fact, syntactic sugar for deeply nested pairs. My advice is to ignore all that and simply use lists. If you ever see ACL2 return a dotted pair, treat it as an indication that you created a list incorrectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The record definition does more than define `:date` and `datep`. It also defines functions for constructing dates and for accessing the elements of a date. For example, the ACL2 expression `(date 10 10 1957)` returns a date object, and if `d` is a date object, then `(date-yy d)` is the year. It also creates functions for \"changing\" the value of the fields. For example, `(set-date-yy 1984 d)` returna **new** date object that has the same day and month as `d`, but with the year 1984. Notice that the `set-` functions return a new object. Remember, there is no such thing as changing the value of a variable in ACL2!\n",

The key observation is that each element of this arbitrarily nested list of integers must be either an integer or a (wait for it) arbitrarily nested list of integers!
